# Sample App

Run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The App has also been deployed and can be tested at `https://d2im18r7jifdzq.cloudfront.net`. (EDIT: AWS Services currently paused - App may not work as supposed to)
The App offers the possibility to upload documents, create and manage Tasks, or chat with other users. Users can be registered by using a valid e-mail address, where they will also receive a verification e-mail. This e-mail address can also be used to request a new password
